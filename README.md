# Social Network Analysis

In this folder you'll find all the code implemented for the Midterm and Final Project of Social Network Analysis Course.

Developers: Mario Martino and Stefano Menduti

## How to run

All files respect the requirements, so it's possible to run final_test.py file in order to see the system's activity.

The final_test.py file just imports the model Affiliation Network, so it's necessary to import the other model generator if it isn't the correct one.
